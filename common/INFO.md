# INFO

## Information for instructors / developers.

The repository contains independent (but interlinked) R Markdown source files for different data-analytic scenarios. These source files are compiled using knitr, and are written using knitrbootstrap and rmarkdown. A custom header file includes links to individual scenarios, and a link to online Bootstrap CSS, that can be used to style the html output.

To view the output .html files in browser, just push changes from the master git branch to gh-pages.
